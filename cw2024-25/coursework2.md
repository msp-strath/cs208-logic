# CS208 Coursework 2

## Proofs in Predicate Logic

This is the second coursework for semester one of CS208 *Logic and
Algorithms* 2024/25.

It is worth 7.5% towards your final mark for all of CS208 (both semesters). The rest was the [first Logic coursework](coursework1.html) (worth 7.5%), Algorithms coursework in semester two (worth 15% in total), and a final exam in April/May 2025 worth 70%.

This coursework is comprised of several proofs for you to complete using the tool introduced in the lectures and videos.

The whole page is marked out of 20.

## Question 1 : Proofs about Edges in Graphs (6 marks)

The following questions all use the rules for [“for all” and “exists”](pred-logic-rules.html), as well as the rules for the propositional connectives.

### Question 1(a) (1 mark)

“If every time there is an edge from *x* to *y* there is an edge from *y* to *x*, and every x has an edge from it to somewhere, then every *x* has an edge leading to it.”

```focused-nd {id=cw2-1a marks=1}
(config
 (name "Question 1(a)")
 (assumptions
  (symmetry "all x. all y. edge(x,y) -> edge(y,x)"))
 (goal "(all x. ex y. edge(x,y)) -> (all x. ex y. edge(y,x))"))
```

### Question 1(b) (1 mark)

“If every time there is an edge from *x* to *y*, there is an edge from *y* to *x*, and there is no edge from a() to b(), then there is no edge from b() to a().”

```focused-nd {id=cw2-1b marks=1}
(config
 (name "Question 1(b)")
 (assumptions
  (symmetry "all x. all y. edge(x,y) -> edge(y,x)"))
 (goal "¬edge(a(),b()) -> ¬edge(b(),a())"))
```

### Question 1(c) (1 mark)

“If every time there is edge from *x* to *y* and an edge from *y* to *z*, there is an edge from *x* to *z*, then if there is an edge from a() to b() and an edge from b() to c(), there is an edge from a() to c().”

```focused-nd {id=cw2-1c marks=1}
(config
 (name "Question 1(c)")
 (assumptions
  (transitivity "all x. all y. all z. edge(x,y) -> edge(y,z) -> edge(x,z)"))
 (goal "edge(a(),b()) -> edge(b(),c()) -> edge(a(),c())"))
```

### Question 1(d) (1 mark)

“If every time there is edge from *x* to *y* and an edge from *y* to *z*, there is an edge from *x* to *z*, and if every time there is an edge from *x* to *y* there is an edge from *y* to *x*, and every *x* has an edge to some *y*, then for all *z*, there is an edge from *z* to *z*.”

```focused-nd {id=cw2-1d marks=1}
(config
 (name "Question 1(d)")
 (assumptions
  (transitivity "all x. all y. all z. edge(x,y) -> edge(y,z) -> edge(x,z)")
  (symmetry "all x. all y. edge(x,y) -> edge(y,x)"))
 (goal "(all x. ex y. edge(x,y)) -> (all z. edge(z,z))"))
```

### Question 1(e) (1 mark)

“If, for all *x* and *y* there is either an edge from *x* to *y* or an edge from *y* to *x*, and there is no edge from a() to b(), then there is an edge from b() to a().”

```focused-nd {id=cw2-1e marks=1}
(config
 (name "Question 1(e)")
 (assumptions
  (either-edge "∀x. ∀y. edge(x, y) ∨ edge(y, x)"))
 (goal "¬edge(a(), b()) → edge(b(), a())"))
```

### Question 1(f) (1 mark)

“If, for all *x* and *y* there is either an edge from *x* to *y* or an edge from *y* to *x*, and for every *x* and *y*, if there is an edge from *x* to *y* there is an edge from *y* to *x*, then for all *x* and *y*, there is an edge from *x* to *y*.”

```focused-nd {id=cw2-1f marks=1}
(config
 (name "Question 1(f)")
 (assumptions
  (either-edge "∀x. ∀y. edge(x, y) ∨ edge(y, x)")
  (symmetry "all x. all y. edge(x,y) -> edge(y,x)"))
 (goal "all x. all y. edge(x,y)"))
```

## Question 2, Children and Dragons (2 marks)

### Question 2(a) (1 mark)

“If every dragon has a child that rides it, and there exists a dragon, then there exists a child.”

```focused-nd {id=cw2-2a marks=1}
(config
 (name "Question 2(a)")
 (assumptions
  (every-dragon-has-a-child "∀i. dragon(i) → (∃c. child(c) ∧ rides(c, i))")
  (exists-a-dragon "∃i. dragon(i)"))
 (goal "∃c. child(c)"))
```

### Question 2(b) (1 mark)

“If every child rides a dragon, and there is a child who doesn't ride a dragon, then the earth is hollow.”

```focused-nd {id=cw2-2b marks=1}
(config
 (name "Question 2(b)")
 (assumptions
  (every-child-rides-a-dragon "∀c. child(c) → (∃i. dragon(i) ∧ rides(c, i))")
  (exists-child-without-dragon "∃c. child(c) ∧ (∀i. dragon(i) → ¬rides(c, i))"))
 (goal "∃p. earth(m) ∧ hollow(m)"))
```

## Question 3, Equality (2 marks)

The following proofs all use the rules for [equality](equality.html).

### Question 3(a) (1 mark)

Equalities can be chained together:

```focused-nd {id=cw2-3a marks=1}
(config
 (name "Question 3(a)")
 (goal "∀x. ∀y. ∀z. x = y → y = z → P(x) → P(z)"))
```

### Question 3(b) (1 mark)

This question asks you to prove that a mirroring function mirrors a specific input, using some axioms that describe how mirroring works on nodes and leaves:

```focused-nd {id=cw2-3b marks=1}
(config
 (name "Question 3(b)")
 (assumptions
  (mirror-leaf "mirror(leaf()) = leaf()")
  (mirror-node "∀x. ∀y. mirror(node(x, y)) = node(mirror(y), mirror(x))"))
 (goal "mirror(node(leaf(), node(leaf(), leaf()))) = node(node(leaf(), leaf()), leaf())"))
```

## Question 4, Monoids (3 marks)

The following proofs all use the rules for [equality](equality.md), and the axioms of a commutative monoid, which is like an abelian group except that there are no inverses (think of positive numbers with addition).

This question and the two following are about a definition of “less than or equal” in terms of addition. We define “*x* <= *y*” to be the formula “*∃ k.  x + k = y*”. So *x* is less than *y* if there is a difference of *k* between them.

### Question 4(a) (1 mark)

The first theorem to prove is that everything is less than or equal to itself for this definition of less than or equal:

```focused-nd {id=cw2-4a marks=1}
(config
 (name "Question 4(a)")
 (assumptions
  (add-zero "∀x. add(x, 0) = x")
  (add-comm "∀x. ∀y. add(x, y) = add(y, x)")
  (add-assoc "∀x. ∀y. ∀z. add(x, add(y, z)) = add(add(x, y), z)"))
 (goal "∀x. ∃k. add(x, k) = x"))
```

### Question 4(b) (1 mark)

Next, zero is less than or equal to everything (so that *0* is the bottom element of the ordering):

```focused-nd {id=cw2-4b marks=1}
(config
 (name "Question 4(b)")
 (assumptions
  (add-zero "∀x. add(x, 0) = x")
  (add-comm "∀x. ∀y. add(x, y) = add(y, x)")
  (add-assoc "∀x. ∀y. ∀z. add(x, add(y, z)) = add(add(x, y), z)"))
 (goal "∀x. ∃k. add(0, k) = x"))
```

### Question 4(c) (1 mark)

And this ordering is transitive, *x <= y* and *y <= z*, then *x <= z*:

```focused-nd {id=cw2-4c marks=1}
(config
 (name "Question 4(c)")
 (assumptions
  (add-zero "∀x. add(x, 0) = x")
  (add-comm "∀x. ∀y. add(x, y) = add(y, x)")
  (add-assoc "∀x. ∀y. ∀z. add(x, add(y, z)) = add(add(x, y), z)"))
 (goal "∀x. ∀y. ∀z. (∃k. add(x, k) = y) → (∃k. add(y, k) = z) → (∃k. add(x, k) = z)"))
```

## Question 5, Induction (7 marks)

The following questions all require proofs by [induction using the Peano axioms for arithmetic](induction.html). In some cases, additional consequences of those axioms that were proved on that page are required. These have been provided as additional assumptions.

### Question 5(a) (1 mark)

“Every number is even or odd”.

```focused-nd {id=cw2-5a marks=1}
(config
 (name "Question 5(a)")
 (assumptions
  (add-zero "∀x. add(0, x) = x")
  (add-succ "∀x. ∀y. add(S(x), y) = S(add(x, y))")
  (add-x-zero "∀x. add(x, 0) = x")
  (add-x-succ "∀x. ∀y. add(x, S(y)) = S(add(x, y))"))
 (goal "∀x. ∃k. x = add(k, k) ∨ x = S(add(k, k))"))
```

### Question 5(b) (1 mark)

“x*0 = 0”.

```focused-nd {id=cw2-5b marks=1}
(config
 (name "Question 5(b)")
 (assumptions
  (add-zero "∀x. add(0, x) = x")
  (add-succ "∀x. ∀y. add(S(x), y) = S(add(x, y))")
  (mul-zero "all x. mul(0,x) = 0")
  (mul-succ "all x. all y. mul(S(x),y) = add(y,mul(x,y))"))
 (goal "∀x. mul(x, 0) = 0"))
```

### Question 5(c) (1 mark)

“x * (1 + y) = x + (x * y)”.

```focused-nd {id=cw2-5c marks=1}
(config
 (name "Question 5(c)")
 (assumptions
  (add-zero "∀x. add(0, x) = x")
  (add-succ "∀x. ∀y. add(S(x), y) = S(add(x, y))")
  (mul-zero "all x. mul(0,x) = 0")
  (mul-succ "all x. all y. mul(S(x),y) = add(y,mul(x,y))")
  (add-assoc "all x. all y. all z. add(x,add(y,z)) = add(add(x,y),z)")
  (add-comm "all x. all y. add(x,y) = add(y,x)"))
 (goal "∀x. ∀y. mul(x, S(y)) = add(x, mul(x, y))"))
```

### Question 5(d) (2 marks)

“if x + y = 0, then x = 0”.

```focused-nd {id=cw2-5d marks=2}
(config
 (name "Question 5(d)")
 (assumptions
  (zero-ne-succ "∀x. ¬0 = S(x)")
  (add-zero "∀x. add(0, x) = x")
  (add-succ "∀x. ∀y. add(S(x), y) = S(add(x, y))"))
 (goal "∀x. ∀y. add(x, y) = 0 → y = 0"))
```

### Question 5(e) (2 marks)

“if x + y = x, then y = 0”.

```focused-nd {id=cw2-5e marks=2}
(config
 (name "Question 5(e)")
 (assumptions
  (succ-injective "∀x. ∀y. S(x) = S(y) → x = y")
  (add-zero "∀x. add(0, x) = x")
  (add-succ "∀x. ∀y. add(S(x), y) = S(add(x, y))"))
 (goal "∀x. ∀y. add(x, y) = x → y = 0"))
```
